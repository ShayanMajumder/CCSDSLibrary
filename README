The open-source CCSDS Library

==Overview==
This library provides a set of C++ classes for generating/interpreting
data packets formatted according to the Consultative Committee for 
Space Data Systems (CCSDS) SpacePacket specifications.
For details of the CCSDS SpacePacket, please refer a pdf document available

==Install==
Download the archive or checkout the git repository, and place the "CCSDSLibrary"
folder anywhere you want. The library consists of header files, and therefore,
no build procedure is required.

When using this library from your application, please add
#include "CCSDS.hh"
and, add the path of the "CCSDSLibrary/includes" to the include path of
your compiler. For example, if you installed the library to
/usr/local/CCSDSLibrary, and the g++ compiler is used, do like below when
compiling:
g++ -I/usr/local/CCSDSLibrary/includes your_application.cc
