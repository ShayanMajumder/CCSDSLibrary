The open-source CCSDS Library

==Overview==
This library provides a set of C++ classes for generating/interpreting
data packets formatted according to the Consultative Committee for 
Space Data Systems (CCSDS) SpacePacket specifications.
For details of the CCSDS SpacePacket, please refer a pdf document available
from the url below:

==Install==
Clone from the github repository,
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/yuasatakayuki/CCSDSLibrary.git
</pre>

Install header files by doing like the following:
<pre>
cd CCSDSLibrary
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
make install
</pre>

This will install all header files to /usr/local/include/CCSDSLibrary. If you want to install to, e.g., $HOME/include, do
<pre>
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME ..
</pre>
instead.

When using this library from your application, please add
#include "CCSDSLibrary/CCSDS.hh"
and, add the path of the "CCSDSLibrary" to the include path of
your compiler. For example, if you installed the library to
/usr/local/include/CCSDSLibrary, and the g++ compiler is used, do like below when
compiling:
<pre>
g++ -I/usr/local/include your_application.cc
</pre>


==Documentation==
The documents/ folder contains a Doxygen file which can be used to
generate an API reference in HTML and RTF.
<pre>
cd SMCPLibrary/documents
doxygen Doxygen
open html/index.html
</pre>
