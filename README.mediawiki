The open-source CCSDS Library

==Overview==
This library provides a set of C++ classes for generating/interpreting
data packets formatted according to the Consultative Committee for 
Space Data Systems (CCSDS) SpacePacket specifications.
For details of the CCSDS SpacePacket, please refer a pdf document available
from the url below:

Github page is:
https://github.com/yuasatakayuki/CCSDSLibrary


==Install==
Clone from the github repository,
	git clone https://github.com/yuasatakayuki/CCSDSLibrary.git

Install header files by doing like the following:
	cd CCSDSLibrary
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
	make install

This will install all header files to /usr/local/include/CCSDSLibrary. If you want to install to, e.g., $HOME/include, do
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME ..
instead.

When using this library from your application, please add
#include "CCSDSLibrary/CCSDS.hh"
and, add the path of the "CCSDSLibrary" to the include path of
your compiler. For example, if you installed the library to
/usr/local/include/CCSDSLibrary, and the g++ compiler is used, do like below when
compiling:
g++ -I/usr/local/include your_application.cc


==Documentation==
The documents/ folder contains a Doxygen file which can be used to
generate an API reference in HTML and RTF.
